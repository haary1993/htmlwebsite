            <h1>Culture</h1>

            <p>"Unity in diversity" - these are not just words, but something that are highly applicable to a
                country like India that is incredibly rich in culture and heritage. A few quotations or statements
                cannot describe the pedestal that India holds on to the world map because of its colourful and unique culture. From the times of Mauryas, Cholas and Mughals to the period of British Empire, India has always been famous for its traditions and hospitality. The warmth in the relations and euphoria in celebrations make the country stand out distinctively in the global fraternity. The country's liveliness and generosity attract a number of tourists
                to its vibrant culture which is an amalgamation of religions, festivals, food, art, crafts, 
                dance, music and many other subtle things. Everything, from the culture and values to customs, 
                rituals and traditions, is 'special' in this 'Land of Gods'.</p>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p> India is one of the oldest countries in the 
                world, full of charming and attractive historical sites and challenging 
                and mysterious stories that were laid in the foundation of Indian cities, regions and even 
                buildings. India is the country of contrasts from architectural and cultural perspectives. If you want to amuse yourself with food, culture, language, clothing and various traditions, India is the right place for you to visit. With the population of over one billion people, India is very multicultural and each of the twenty eight states in the country has
                its unique identity that determines and directs its history</p>

            <h1>Languages</h1>
            <p> Map of South Asia in native languages.                The languages of India primarily belong to two major linguistic families, Indo-European (whose branch Indo-Aryan is spoken by about 75 percent of the population)
                and Dravidian (spoken by about 25 percent). Other languages spoken in India come mainly from the Austro-Asiatic and Tibeto-Burman linguistic families, 
                as well as a few language isolates. Individual mother tongues in India number several hundred,
                and more than a thousand if major dialects are included.[1]The SIL Ethnologue lists 415 languages                       for India; 24 of these languages are spoken by more than a million native speakers, and 114 by more than 10,000. Three millennia of political and social contact have resulted in mutual influence among the four language 
                families in India and South Asia. Two contact languages have 
                played an important role in the history of India: Persian and English.</p>
